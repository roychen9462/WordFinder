DESCRIPTION OF YOUR CLASS DESIGN AND ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES USED:
In this program, I use mainly use four classes to solve the problem.

1. WordFinder:
This is the main class that builds the user interface for generating anagrams. Users can input a word of interest, and
the program will generate all possible anagrams of the word, including its subsets. The anagrams are then sorted based
on their score.

2. AnagramDictionary:
To create an anagrams dictionary based on a user-defined dictionary file, a hashMap can be utilized. The hashMap uses
a sorted "String" as the key and a hashSet as the corresponding value. The hashSet contains all the words with the same
pattern after sorting the characters in the word. This approach allows us to quickly find all the anagrams contained
in the dictionary for any given word with just one lookup.

3. Rack:
The purpose of this class is to generate a list of words sorted by their characters to be used as keys for the
AnagramDictionary lookup. Before generating the list, the input string is preprocessed by removing all special
characters.

4. ScoreTable:
This class provides a static method to calculate the score of any given string using the hard-coded scoreMap, which
is implemented as a hashMap. The scoreMap assigns a score to each character in the string, and the method computes
the score of the entire string by adding up the individual scores of its characters.

The program essentially generates a list of keys for a user-defined word and checks each key against the
anagramDictionary to find any matching anagrams. Any anagrams found are then sorted based on their score and displayed
in the terminal as output.
